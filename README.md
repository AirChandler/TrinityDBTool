Tool is still in early development and not recommended for personal use, watch out for future releases under releases.
  -Development on tool restarting on 21st March, possibilities includes support for multiple versions of trinity core, primarily supporting <3.3.5 db schema as well as expanding current skyfire db support to cata+, requires interface rehaul.
